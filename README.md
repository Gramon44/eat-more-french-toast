# french-toast
# This is my first project pushed to github.
# It is a simple web page about how to make french toast and what ingredients you will need in order to make it. As of now it only includes basic elements like a head, title, metadata, body and an anchor tag. It also includes different headings, ordered and unordered lists and an image.
